# A Proper API Crash Course

???

Introduce myself

---

# Who am I?

- Currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Apto
- 4 years software engineering, 11 years programming

- Twitter: @brainchildpro

- Github: james-gibson

- Denver Devs Slack: james.the.nodester

- This Presentation: http://james-gibson.github.io/apiTips/

### API Credentials

- Self hosted home automation software
- Built and maintained a worldwide energy usage dashboard for the US NAVY
- Migrated a v0 to v1 for an indoor location analytics software
- Consulted on skunkworks API design for a Fortune 25 company

---
# Define a few things

- Wikipedia defines an API as:

```Text
In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set
of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API
expresses a software component in terms of its operations, inputs, outputs, 
and underlying types.
```

--

- In practice an API is:

```Text
Getting system A to do work for system B
```
???
Now you might be asking what do I mean?
---

## What do you mean 'do work'?

--

An API can provide

- Detailed weather forecasts (forcast.io)

--

- In depth directions (Google Maps)

--

- Awesome & fresh music (Soundcloud)

--

## But these sound trivial

--

- An API can help you find a house (Zillow)

--

- An API can give you control over your entire production deployment (Amazon EC2)

--

- An API can give you insight into natural language (Alchemy API)

## So API's are awesome right?

--

# Not Always!

---

## Huh?

- Not all API's are created equally

- You may have the chance to work on really well designed API's

--

## but...

--

- You will more then likely have to work on really bad API's

???

While you cant really do anything but suffer through the bad API's

---

## Avoid the common pitfalls

- Many common mistakes occur simply due to lack of experience

--

- You can either make an API that developers either:

---

- Hate

### This is where I can help

--

#### Sounds great, where do we start?

---

### 40,000ms is a loooong time

  - Every ms that your request takes is time that adds up for the end user.
  - Not every developer has the same level of restrictions that you do
    - Some platforms impose timeout limits that cannot be raised
    - Eating up transaction time with requests is a generally easy problem to fix.

???
I have seen production web services(POST's can invoke invoices of thousands of dollars) that were considered acceptable to take 40+ seconds!+

Proper indexing of this service, at my coworker and myself's request, sped the request up to 200ms+

---

## Fail fast, and fail hard

```javascript
function verifyUserKey(req,res,next) {
    var streamToken = req.query.id;
    var key = req.query.key;
    var token = authModel.getToken(user,key);
    if(!token) { return res.json({message:"Invalid User and Key"}); }
    req.token = token;
    next();
}
```

#### Horrible example, lets fix it up

---

## Fail fast, and fail hard

```javascript
function verifyUserKey(req,res,next) {
*    //Fail before making database calls
*    if(typeof req.query.key === "undefined"
*        || req.query.user === "undefined" {
*        return res.json({message:"Invalid User and Key"});
*    }

    var streamToken = req.query.id;
    var key = req.query.key;
    var token = authModel.getToken(user,key);

    req.token = token;
    next();
}
```


Validate API inputs early

--
However, returning `200 OK` for every request masks issues.

![Having a baby has really driven home how terrible it is when several issues result in the same error message ~ @andrewtraviss](http://content.screencast.com/users/JGibson443/folders/Snagit/media/9d796a34-3425-400f-a284-70276cb42809/2015-09-08_10-49-28.png)

--

There are use cases for returning a 200 OK on every request, but generally not for modern API development 


---

## But Fail Gracefully

```javascript
function verifyUserKey(req,res,next) {
    //Fail before making database calls
    if(typeof req.query.key === "undefined"
        || req.query.user === "undefined" {
*        res.statusCode = 401;
         return res.json({message:"Invalid User and Key"});
    }

    var streamToken = req.query.id;
    var key = req.query.key;
    var token = authModel.getToken(user,key);

    req.token = token;
    next();
}
```

[HTTP status codes exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes), use them!

---

## And Impress your consumers

```javascript
function verifyUserKey(req,res,next) {
    //Fail before making database calls
    if(typeof req.query.key === "undefined"
        || req.query.user === "undefined" {
         res.statusCode = 401;
*        return res.json({message:"Invalid User and Key", "code":401});
    }

    var streamToken = req.query.id;
    var key = req.query.key;
    var token = authModel.getToken(user,key);

    req.token = token;
    next();
}
```

Some consumers actually won't have access to the underlying response status code
while this is not required, it can make integrating with your API easier.

Flash was a good example of this, the browsers would catch failed requests and not allow the runtime access to the underlying error.

---
## Be remarkable

--

- Operate under the principle of least surprise 
  - Developers that use your API are almost always on a time crunch
  - Respect their time and make learning your API a no brainer
    - This can be accomplished by providing working examples, good documentation and consistent assumptions
    
???
I have worked with an API that required parameters be in a specific order, but that order was not enforced consistently
