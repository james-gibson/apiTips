# A Proper API Crash Course

???

Introduce myself

---

# Who am I?

- Currently working as the lead developer at Apto
- 3 years software engineering, 11 years programming

---
# Define a few things

- Wikipedia defines an API as:

```Text
In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set
of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API
expresses a software component in terms of its operations, inputs, outputs, 
and underlying types.
```

--

- In practice an API is:

```Text
Getting system A to do work for system B
```
???
Now you might be asking what do I mean?
---

## What do you mean do work?

--

- An API can tell you the weather (forcast.io)

--

- An API can give you directions (Google Maps)

--

- An API can give you awesome music (Soundcloud)

--

## But these sound trivial

--

- An API can help you find a house (Zillow)

--

- An API can give you control over your entire production deployment (Amazon EC2)

--

- An API can give you insight into natural language (Alchemy API)

## So API's are awesome right?

--

# Not Always!

---

## Huh?

- Not all API's are created equally

- You may have the chance to work on really well designed API's

--

## but...

--

- You will more then likely have to work on really bad API's

???

While you cant really do anything but suffer through the bad API's

---

## Avoid the common pitfalls

- Many common mistakes occur simply due to lack of experience

--

- You can either make an API that developers either:
    - Rave over
    - Hate

### This is where I can help

--

#### Sounds great, where do we start?

---

### 40,000ms is a loooong time

  - Every ms that your request takes is time that adds up for the end user.
  - Not every developer has the same level of restrictions that you do
    - Some platforms impose timeout limits that cannot be raised
    - Eating up transaction time with requests is a generally easy problem to fix.

???
I have seen production web services(POST's can invoke invoices of thousands of dollars) that were considered acceptable to take 40+ seconds!+

Proper indexing of this service, at my coworker and myself's request, sped the request up to 200ms+

---

## Fail fast, and fail hard

#### Slow way

```javascript
function verifyUserKey(req,res,next) {
    var streamToken = req.query.id;
    var key = req.query.key;
    var token = authModel.getToken(user,key);
    if(!token) { return res.json({message:"Invalid User and Key"}); }
    req.token = token;
    next();
}
```

---

## Fail fast, and fail hard

- Validate API inputs early

```javascript
function verifyUserKey(req,res,next) {
*    //Fail before making database calls
*    if(typeof key === "undefined"
*        || user === "undefined" {
*        return res.json({message:"Invalid User and Key"});
*    }

    var streamToken = req.query.id;
    var key = req.query.key;
    var token = authModel.getToken(user,key);

    req.token = token;
    next();
}
```

---

## But Fail Gracefully

- Validate API inputs early

```javascript
function verifyUserKey(req,res,next) {
    //Fail before making database calls
    if(typeof key === "undefined"
        || user === "undefined" {
*        res.statusCode = 401;
*        return res.json({message:"Invalid User and Key", code:401});
    }

    var streamToken = req.query.id;
    var key = req.query.key;
    var token = authModel.getToken(user,key);

    req.token = token;
    next();
}
```
